# Homework:

# 1. Given a side of square. Find its perimeter and area.
side = 5
perimeter = 4 * side
area = side ** 2
print("Perimeter:", perimeter)
print("Area:", area)

# 2. Given diameter of circle. Find its length.
diameter = 10
circumference = math.pi * diameter
print("Length (Circumference):", circumference)

# 3. Given two numbers a and b. Find their mean.
a = 7
b = 13
mean = (a + b) / 2
print("Mean:", mean)

# 4. Given two numbers a and b. Find their sum, product and square of each number.
sum_ab = a + b
product_ab = a * b
square_a = a ** 2
square_b = b ** 2
print("Sum:", sum_ab)
print("Product:", product_ab)
print("Square of a:", square_a)
print("Square of b:", square_b)
